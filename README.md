# AWS Project 2: Load Balanced Architecture with Advanced Request Routing

## üìå Overview
In this project, I deployed a load-balanced web application using Amazon EC2 and an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The project includes a **path-based** routing to direct traffic to different EC2 instances based on the request.

This is part of a hands-on learning series inspired by [Neil Davis's AWS projects](https://digitalcloud.training).

## üß∞ Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Target Groups
- Listener Rules
- Security Groups

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Did
- Launched 2 EC2 instances with unique content
- Created an ALB and configured target groups
- Set up **path-based routing** (e.g., `/red`, `/blue`)
- Tested and validated routing behavior via browser
